# News_Site_Webscraping-BeautifulSoup

# Primary Objective
The goal of this project is to use the BeautifulSoup library to scrape a new site for articles that pertain to a given stock on the stock market (based off of ticket symbols). The title, date, description, and url link will be stored in a .csv file.

# Secondary Objective
The second goal is to obtain closing stock prices, of the selected stocks, and use a simple trendline model to predict if the stock is a BUY, SELL, or WAIT/HOLD.
